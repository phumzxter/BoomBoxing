        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Boom Boxing is a 3D fighting game inspired by the boxing fighting style. One point that differentiate
                this
                game from others is that you are playing as the instructor who gives the voice commands to demand the
                character to play as their commands.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/Noisy_Boy.png" alt="example">
            <p>Inspired by the robot named Noisy Boy from the movie “Real Steel” which is a high-profile brawler robot
                able
                to function and fight with the owner's voice command. We found that it would be very great if we could
                have
                that kind of robot one day. But unluckily, it doesn't seem like we were born in the same era. So we
                decided
                that if we cannot have such a robot, we can make a game instead to fulfill our wishes. </p>

            <h2>Goal making the game:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This project is aiming to design and develop a good function and average graphic game which easy to
                access and play by the mass audience, there are various objective we are seeking to achieve as follows:
            </p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>- The game is responsive with pre-setup voice command. </p>
            <p>- Improving the latency when players use microphone that allows player to play the game without having
                latency.</p>
            <p>- The game functions as a normal fighting game with expected reaction from characters.</p>
            <p>- The AI player in offline mode can react faster and smarter, avoid boring feeling when player play the
                game.</p>
            <p>- For this project of us, we are expecting to launch the game on web platform that allows players to
                download and providing source code for programmers who have interesting in improving the game. If the
                responses of the game are positive, we are planning to update and make it available for players and can
                be downloaded from game downloading platforms like steam, …</p>
