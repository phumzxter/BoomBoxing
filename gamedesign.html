                    <p>In this part, we mostly use blender as our main source to generate graphic and model for the
                        game.</p>
                    <p> Since the scope of the game is to make a 2,5 to 3D game, which will require the graphic
                        and models from the game must be 3d model. That make Blender 3d become the best platform for use
                        to generate the graphic for the game.</p>
                    <p>
                        There are many tutorials from the internet to learn making 3d models with Blender 3d, there are
                        no limit to the model you can make with blender. For this specific game, we have implemented the
                        character model and the stage model using blender. </p>
                    <p>For the surrounding area, we decided to
                        download a free model of a stadium on internet as the surroundings areas. </p>

                        blender and the stadium files are in .fbx form and can be dragged and dropped directly to Unity.
                        In our project folder, there are a prefabricated folder which holding all the material and
                        models of the game. Which can be used later in developing the game. </p>

                <div class="col-9">
                    <p>For a fighting game like Boomboxing, it is necessary that the character must move and throw
                        punches in a form of a boxer, or at least have the movement animations so that player can see
                        exactly what the character are doing. </p>
                    <p>Blender also supplies helps for developer in making
                        animations for the character which has been created by blender. But for the ease of use and
                        judging from the professional perspective, the animation that we make cannot be like an actual
                        action in real life. For that reason, our group have decided to use download pre-made animations
                        from Mixamo.com, a website that allow people to upload or download animation for different
                        action that their need (it can be for other reasons beside game making). Most of the animation
                        that we used in Boom Boxing were downloaded and import to unity from mixamo.com, since animation
                        is a common term to Unity game making. </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/light-punch.gif" alt="">
                    <p> There is no difficulty in importing all the model into
                        our project. One note for this is that the animation for human can only be applied for human
                        models, otherwise, Unity will throw an error. </p>

                    <p>Audio is also a needed material in making a video game, although it does not affect the game, but
                        it has an enormous impact in encouraging player feeling and mood when playing the game. </p>
                    <p>  An easy
                        example for this can be seen from the game Flappy Bird, the implementation of the game is
                        amazingly simple but by choosing and design the music wisely, the player will want to play the
                        game increasingly. </p>
                    <p> In this project, we have download free music instead of making our own (which
                        will require a lot of effort). The music is downloaded from OpengameArt.org, which supply not
                        only the sound effect for the game but there is also background music to be used for designing
                        menu, â€¦</p>

                    <p>Similar to all the game on the marker currently, Hud design are compulsory. Menu and HP bars with
                        time counting are the 2 components in this project that require the use of HUD. </p>
                    <p>For these 2
                        components, we have designed them with the help of Unity. Unity does provide method to add HUD
                        to the game as well as adding the button to the game. The only need is C# file which connect
                        these components from Unity object and gives conditions so those HUD components can be
                        interactable. </p>    
                    <p>There are 3 files in the Script section of the project, which are
                        HUDcontroller.cs, menumanagement.cs and pausemenu.cs. These 3 files connect with the HUD
                        components and make them work as we want it to be. As a result, this picture is to show all main
                        HUD appear in our game.
