                        </h2>

                    <div class="col-9">
                        <p>Voice control is the core of this project, since the original scope of this project is to
                            have the game that can be controlled with player voice. Normally, the input system of Unity
                            is from keyboard and mouse for computer games, for mobile games, we have the hand gesture
                            and the input from the screen. There are games that allow player to play with voice, but to
                            be more accurate, it is more like a pitch recognition instead of voice recognition.</p>
                        <p>For this project, our goal is to have the game listened to player instructions (words and
                            phrase). Since there are no prebuilt function in Unity to recognize word, but we can still
                            find a class from unity documents, which named keywordrecognizer, this class allows
                            developers to make the game listen and recognize the key word or phrase that has been set
                            up. </p>
                        <p> There are other ways we find out to be possible for voice recognition such as calling API
                            from big data, but doing this will require to pay money. As a result, keywordrecognizer are
                            picked to be our core function in this game.</p>
                        <p>To be more specific, keywordrecognizer is a class in UnityEngine.Windows.Speech that listens
                            to speech input and attempts to match uttered phrases to a list of registered keywords. </p>
                        <p>
                            There can be many keyword recognizers active at any given time, but no two keyword
                            recognizers may be listening for the same keyword. This result in many constraints to our
                            project since there have to be many modifications in the code of the game in order to keep 2
                            keywordrecognizers from having the same key words.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            How do we apply keywordrecognizer in our project?
                        </h2>

                        <p>This is the example of running keywordrecognizer taken directly from Unity documentation.
                            From the example, both keyword and phrase are listened. But in the scope of our project,
                            there are only keywords that need to be recognize. In our project, the code is written
                            directly to the character prefabricated controller, the idea is amazingly simple, if the
                            word is recognized, trigger the action (if keyword is “punch”, then trigger action punch
                            from character animation controller). </p>
                        <img src="assets/images/code_keyword.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                        <p> There are many constraints that we have gotten from using keywordrecognizer, as mentioned
                            earlier, the 2 keyword recognizers cannot listen to the same keyword. Which do not allow the
                            offline mode and online mode to be controlled with the same keyword set. As a solution for
                            this problem. We have prepared 3 set of keywords which have the same meaning as of the
                            moving instructions. 1 will be used for the offline mode and other will be used randomly for
                            2 players in multiplayer modes. By doing this, we are expecting the player not to have any
                            advantage against other when it comes to multiplayer mode. </p>
                        <p> Keywordrecognizer might not be the best option for this project, but as in the scope of the
                            project, all the function are except able. We will keep working on the voice recognition in
                            the future to find a better solution for this voice control problem, or produce our own
                            class or code to recognize player voice input. </p>
